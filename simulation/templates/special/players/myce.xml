    <History>
      The Myceneans were a greek kingdom in the late bronze age,
      but in this context we mean the greek alliance, that wanted to capture Troy,
      because the trojan prince Paris kidnapped the spartan queen Helen.
      The trojans were excellent warriors, but the greek still had an ace up their sleeve.
      Achilles, joung king of Pthia, the best warrior of his era,
      led 4000 of the most disciplined soldiers of greece, called "Myrmidons".
